# Mocha-Titles-01
My first dynamic website created as a project for my Web design class: This was created using both Hand coding and Adobe Dreamweaver . The website is about a black owned book store that sells books authored by black or POC authors. It also doubles as a coffee shop with a full menu and description of coffee items and bakery treats

PLEASE AKNOWLEDGE you do not have permision to copy, distribute, or use this code in anyway shape or form.

Here is also the finished product : https://mason.gmu.edu/~dtalley/Project%205/bakery_menu/index.html
